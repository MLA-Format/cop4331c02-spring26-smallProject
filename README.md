Used Claude to understand the login.php provided by Professor Leinecker. During this, Claude recommended moving sensitive data to a .env file. After this suggestion, I read about how to set up a .env file in PHP and the security benefits. I also discussed the necessary setup and server structure for the .env file with Claude.

I also used Claude to help understand why I cannot push an empty folder to a github repository as well as to find a workaround to this. The workaround was using .gitkeep files.
